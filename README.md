## Introduction

Readability is a critical aspect of any written document, as it determines how easily readers can comprehend the content. This project provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing the readability of documents using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and widely-used readability metrics.

The tool processes `.docx` files to calculate various readability statistics, such as word count, sentence count, Flesch Reading Ease, and many others. It also includes advanced insights like passive sentence detection using NLP.

---

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a tool that:
- **Preprocesses documents**: Converts `.docx` files into plain text for readability analysis.
- **Calculates readability metrics**: Leverages established formulas to evaluate document readability.
- **Generates detailed statistics**: Provides advanced insights such as passive sentence counts and average characters per word.
- **Exports results**: Saves the statistics in a structured format (CSV) for further analysis.

## Features

1. **Multi-Metric Readability Analysis**:
   - Flesch Reading Ease
   - Flesch-Kincaid Grade
   - Gunning Fog Index
   - Dale-Chall Readability Score
   - SMOG Index
   - Automated Readability Index

2. **Text Statistics**:
   - Total Characters
   - Total Words
   - Total Sentences
   - Total Paragraphs
   - Words per Sentence
   - Characters per Word
   - Sentences per Paragraph

3. **Advanced NLP-Based Insights**:
   - Passive Sentence Count (using SpaCy).

4. **Batch Processing**:
   - Automatically processes multiple `.docx` files in a folder.

5. **Output**:
   - Saves all statistics in a CSV file for easy reporting and analysis.

## Libraries Used

- **re**: Regular expressions for text processing.
- **spacy**: Advanced NLP library for passive voice detection.
- **textstat**: Readability metrics computation.
- **os**: File management and folder traversal.
- **docx**: Reads `.docx` files to extract text.

---

## Workflow

1. **Input**: The tool takes a folder of `.docx` files as input.
2. **Text Extraction**: Reads and preprocesses the text from each file.
3. **Readability Metrics Calculation**: Computes multiple readability metrics and text statistics.
4. **NLP Analysis**: Uses SpaCy to identify passive sentences.
5. **Output**: Exports the results as a CSV file for reporting.

---

## Use Cases

1. **Content Optimization**: Evaluate the readability of marketing brochures, technical documents, or educational material.
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure that legal or healthcare documents meet readability standards.
3. **Academic Analysis**: Analyze the complexity of academic papers or essays.
4. **User-Friendly Content**: Tailor content for different audiences by improving readability scores.

---

## Advantages

1. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Provides a wide range of readability metrics and text statistics.
2. **Advanced NLP Integration**: Identifies passive sentences using SpaCy for better writing insights.
3. **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple documents simultaneously, saving time.
4. **Customizable and Extensible**: Easily integrate with additional tools or pipelines.

## Improvements and Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Format File Processing**:
   - Add support for `.pdf`, `.txt`, and `.html` files.
   - Use libraries like `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber` for PDF processing.

2. **LLM-Powered Analysis**:
   - Incorporate large language models (LLMs) to generate summaries or improve readability metrics.
   - Use APIs such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT or Google Bard for context-aware readability analysis.

3. **User Interface**:
   - Create a web-based interface using Flask or Streamlit for user-friendly interaction.

4. **Real-Time Insights**:
   - Provide real-time feedback and suggestions for improving readability.

## Example Code Snippet

```python
import re
import spacy
import textstat
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

def calculate_all_statistics(text):
    stats = {
        "Flesch Reading Ease": textstat.flesch_reading_ease(text),
        "Flesch-Kincaid Grade": textstat.flesch_kincaid_grade(text),
        "Gunning Fog Index": textstat.gunning_fog(text),
        "Dale-Chall Readability Score": textstat.dale_chall_readability_score(text),
        "Automated Readability Index": textstat.automated_readability_index(text),
        "SMOG Index": textstat.smog_index(text),
        "Reading Time (seconds)": textstat.reading_time(text, ms_per_char=14.69),
        "Passive Sentences": passive_sentence_count(text),
    }
    return stats
```

### **Important Notes**

- Ensure that all .docx files are well-formatted for accurate text extraction.
- For multi-format support, additional libraries will be required.
- To analyze larger documents or datasets, consider optimizing the text processing pipeline.
